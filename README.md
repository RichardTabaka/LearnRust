# Learn Rust Repository

Welcome to my Learn Rust repository! This repository contains various Rust projects that I'm working on as I learn and practice Rust. Each project is organized as a separate member of a Cargo workspace for easy management and collaboration.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of small Rust projects that I plan to build as I progress through my Rust learning journey. The projects will range from simple command-line tools to more complex applications, and are inspired by various resources, including the [Zero to Mastery Rust Practice Projects](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/) article.

## Projects

Here are some of the sample projects that I plan to build and include in this repository:

- **Shell**: A simple command-line tool that will be capable of executing some of the typical commands you'd expect from a Shell.
- **ToDo List**: A typical first project when learning a language, a ToDo list that can be added to and modified to track tasks.
- **ACID Database**: Depending on my comfort level at this point it will likely either be a Redis clone(like the one [I completed in Go](https://github.com/RichardTabaka/RediSetGo)) or a graph database.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized using a Cargo workspace, which allows multiple Rust projects to coexist within a single repository. The root `Cargo.toml` file manages the workspace configuration, and each project resides in its own directory.
